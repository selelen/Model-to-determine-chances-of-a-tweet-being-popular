# Determine chances of a tweet being popular

In this scenario, we’ve seen that the key to get more engagement on Twitter is creating good content (not spam!) and sharing it over popular tweets when before after the tweet’s publication. For example, if a famous person talks about how sport affects children’s development - sharing an article that delves into this topic in the comments could bring us many users.

So the question is: how can we predict which tweets are going to be popular?

So our job is to be able to provide intelligence on which tweets can become "popular" and valid for our strategy.
